Audio Transcription and Summarization with FastAPI

Objective
Developing a system that handles audio files by transcribing them, summarizing the content, extracting timestamps, and saving the results locally. Additionally, you will implement a FastAPI server to handle endpoints for this process.

Transcription: Utilize the whisper-large-v3 model from OpenAI to transcribe the audio file provided. Implement this using asynchronous endpoints in FastAPI to handle potentially large audio files efficiently. Ensure the transcription handles common audio formats such as .wav, .mp3, etc.

Summarization: Use any suitable summarization model to generate a concise summary of the transcribed text from the audio file.

Timestamp Extraction: Extract timestamps or time intervals from the audio file where key events or changes in content occur. These timestamps should be correlated with the transcription.

Implementation
Whisper
Whisper is an advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to transcribe spoken language into written text with exceptional accuracy. Whisper excels at handling a variety of accents, background noises, and multiple languages, making it a robust tool for diverse transcription needs.

Audio Transcription
Audio transcription is the process of converting spoken words from an audio file into written text. This process is useful for generating meeting notes, creating subtitles for videos, enhancing accessibility for the hearing impaired, and many other applications.

Real-Time Use Case: Sentiment Analysis
Unique Real-World Application: Sentiment Analysis of Transcriptions

This project not only transcribes and summarizes audio files but can also be extended for sentiment analysis of the transcriptions. Imagine you have a large number of customer service calls, and you need to analyze the overall sentiment of these conversations to improve customer satisfaction.

Use Case: Customer Feedback Analysis

Step 1: Transcription: Upload audio recordings of customer service calls.

Step 2: Summarization: Get a concise summary of each call.

Step 3: Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the transcriptions to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the conversations.

By integrating sentiment analysis, you can:

Improve Customer Service: Identify areas where customer service can be improved based on sentiment trends.
Track Performance: Monitor the effectiveness of customer service representatives.
Enhance Customer Experience: Use insights to enhance overall customer satisfaction.
Project Description
This project offers a powerful API for converting audio files into text and summarizing the resulting transcriptions. By using cutting-edge machine learning models from the transformers library, the API provides reliable and efficient audio processing capabilities.

Key Points
Transcription Service: Upload an audio file and receive a text transcription.
Summarization Service: Obtain a concise summary of the transcribed text.
Timestamp Service: Get word-level timestamps for the transcription, detailing when each word was spoken.
